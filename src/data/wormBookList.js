    Techniques and systems for processing food scraps, manure, yard debris, paper, and more

    Turning waste into wealth sounds too good to be true, but many worm farmers are finding that vermicomposting is a reliable way to do just that. Vermicast―a biologically active, nutrient-rich mix of earthworm castings and decomposed organic matter―sells for $400 or more per cubic yard. Compare that to regular compost, sold at about $30 a cubic yard, and you’ll see why vermicomposting has taken root in most countries and on every continent but Antarctica.

    Vermicomposting is also one of the best sustainable solutions for organic waste management. Vermicomposting manure and crop wastes on farms improves crop yields while reducing demand for off-farm inputs. Vermicast has higher nutrient levels and lower soluble salt content than regular compost, and it improves soil aeration, porosity, and water retention. Plus, vermicast suppresses plant diseases and insect attacks. Municipalities, businesses, community gardens, schools, and universities can set up vermicomposting operations to process food residuals and other waste materials.

    The Worm Farmer’s Handbook details the ins and outs of vermicomposting for mid- to large-scale operations, including how to recycle organic materials ranging from food wastes and yard trimmings to manure and shredded office paper. Vermicomposting expert Rhonda Sherman shares what she has learned over twenty-five years working with commercial worm growers and researchers around the world. Her profiles of successful worm growers across the United States and from New Zealand to the Middle East and Europe describe their proven methods and systems.

    This book digs into all the details, including:

    Choosing the right production system
    Regulatory issues and developing a business and marketing plan
    Finding and managing feedstocks
    Pre-composting: why and how to do it
    Monitoring an active worm bed
    Harvesting, screening, testing, packaging, and storing vermicast
    Markets for earthworms and vermicast
    Food security: how vermicast benefits soils and plants
    Keys to success: avoiding common pitfalls
    From livestock farms and restaurants to colleges, military bases, and prisons, Sherman details why and how commercial-scale vermicomposting is a fast-growing, sustainable solution for organic waste management. The Worm Farmer’s Handbook is the first and only authoritative how-to guide that goes beyond small-scale operations and demystifies the science and logistics of the fascinating process that is vermicomposting.`,

      Are you stressed out about…

      The seemingly steady decline in both the quantity and quality of your crops?
      “Technical farming problems” like soil erosion and biodiversity loss?
      Climate change—how you can cope with it, and how you can be part of the solution rather than the problem?

      If so, chances are you’re suffering from eco-anxiety… and unfortunately, you have good reason to do so.

      According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), each year, an estimated 24 billion tons of fertile soil are lost due to erosion. That’s a whopping 3.4 tons lost every year for each person on the planet.

      This is quite a serious issue, considering the fact that it takes approximately 500 years for a 2.5-centimeter layer of fertile topsoil to form under agricultural conditions—and our food security ultimately depends on soil quality.

      But the good news is there’s a way to reverse the damage… and you can be part of the solution… through regenerative agriculture!

      Regenerative agriculture has countless benefits— producing nutrient-dense food, combating climate change, enhancing ecosystem biodiversity, improving air and water quality, huge savings from higher yields, using fewer synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides… the list goes on and on!

      Now, if it sounds like you’re going to need technical expertise to do this… don’t worry. Understanding your soil and giving it what it needs doesn’t have to be complicated.

      Start with this easy-to-read guide filled with practical advice and information on how to improve your relationship with your soil and get the most out of it!

      Here’s just a fraction of what you’ll discover from this book:

      8 reasons you should stop tilling RIGHT NOW—and what you should be doing instead
      Why carbon isn’t the main bad guy in our “carbon problem”
      How we’ve been jeopardizing our soil quality—and aquatic life—since the industrial revolution
      Why organic fertilizer won’t solve all your soil problems—and what you should know before grabbing a bag or two for your garden
      7 essential soil tests to help you figure out everything you need to know about your soil
      The hidden downsides of generating renewable energy through hydropower
      The key to maximizing plant health for optimum crop quality
      How to compost—the right way!
      A Korean farming method that helps you eliminate the need for chemical fertilizers
      A 9-step soil regeneration action plan to produce high-quality topsoil
      And so much more.

      Even if you don’t think you have a green thumb and don’t have the slightest idea of what soil science is, you’ll be able to boost your soil quality in no time with these simple techniques.
